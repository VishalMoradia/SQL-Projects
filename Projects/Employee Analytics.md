# Employee-Analytics---SQL

# Problem Statement

**HR Analytica** has asked specifically to generate database views that HR Analytica team can use for 2 key dashboards, reporting solutions and ad-hoc analytics requests.

# Data Exploration

### Table Indexes 

We can query our tables and their index information by accessing the pg_indexes table as shown below:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'employees';
```

In the output of the above query, we can see that all tables have unique indexes.

### Individual Table Analysis

##### Employee

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees.employee
LIMIT 5;
```

##### Department

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees.department;
```

##### Department Employees

```sql
SELECT *
FROM employees.department_employee
LIMIT 5;
```

##### Department Manager

```sql 
SELECT *
FROM employees.department_manager
LIMIT 5;
```

##### Salary

Investigating salary table using only one employee information.

```sql 
SELECT *
FROM employees.salary
WHERE employee_id = 10001
ORDER BY from_date DESC;
```

Lets look at the duplicate values in this tables as there can be multiple records for one employee.

```sql
WITH employee_id_cte AS (
SELECT
 employee_id,
 COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM employees.salary
GROUP BY employee_id
)
SELECT
 row_count,
 COUNT(DISTINCT employee_id) AS employee_count
FROM employee_id_cte
GROUP BY row_count
ORDER BY row_count DESC;
```

The majority of employee records in this salary table will have more than 1 record so we should be careful when joining this table with the others.

# Analysis

### Data Cleaning

Firstly - we will need to adjust all of our relevant date fields due to the data issue identified by HR Analytica.

We will be incrementing all of the date fields except the arbitrary end date of 9999-01-01 - we will also need to cast our results back to a DATE data type as 
PostgreSQL interval addition forces the data type to a TIMESTAMP which we’d like to avoid to keep our data as similar to the original as possible.
We will be implementing our adjusted datasets as materialized views with exact original indexes as per the original tables in the employees schema.

```sql
DROP SCHEMA IF EXISTS mv_employees CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA mv_employees;

-- department
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.department;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees.department AS
SELECT * FROM employees.department;

-- department employee
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.department_employee;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees.department_employee AS
SELECT
  employee_id,
  department_id,
  (from_date + interval '18 years')::DATE AS from_date,
  CASE
    WHEN to_date <> '9999-01-01' THEN (to_date + interval '18 years')::DATE
    ELSE to_date
    END AS to_date
FROM employees.department_employee;

-- department manager
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.department_manager;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees.department_manager AS
SELECT
  employee_id,
  department_id,
  (from_date + interval '18 years')::DATE AS from_date,
  CASE
    WHEN to_date <> '9999-01-01' THEN (to_date + interval '18 years')::DATE
    ELSE to_date
    END AS to_date
FROM employees.department_manager;

-- employee
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.employee;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees.employee AS
SELECT
  id,
  (birth_date + interval '18 years')::DATE AS birth_date,
  first_name,
  last_name,
  gender,
  (hire_date + interval '18 years')::DATE AS hire_date
FROM employees.employee;

-- salary
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.salary;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees.salary AS
SELECT
  employee_id,
  amount,
  (from_date + interval '18 years')::DATE AS from_date,
  CASE
    WHEN to_date <> '9999-01-01' THEN (to_date + interval '18 years')::DATE
    ELSE to_date
    END AS to_date
FROM employees.salary;

-- title
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.title;
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employees.title AS
SELECT
  employee_id,
  title,
  (from_date + interval '18 years')::DATE AS from_date,
  CASE
    WHEN to_date <> '9999-01-01' THEN (to_date + interval '18 years')::DATE
    ELSE to_date
    END AS to_date
FROM employees.title;

-- Index Creation
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.employee USING btree (id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.department_employee USING btree (employee_id, department_id);
CREATE INDEX        ON mv_employees.department_employee USING btree (department_id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.department USING btree (id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.department USING btree (dept_name);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.department_manager USING btree (employee_id, department_id);
CREATE INDEX        ON mv_employees.department_manager USING btree (department_id);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.salary USING btree (employee_id, from_date);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ON mv_employees.title USING btree (employee_id, title, from_date);
```

### Current Snapshot Analysis

#### Analysis Plan 

1. Using LAG() window function to get the previous salary amount where records are only limited to, to_date = '9999-01-01'
2. Apply WHERE filter to keep only current records and exclude historic records.
3. Using gender column in every table and every calculation as per our requirement.
4. Use the hire_date column from the employee view to calculate the number of tenure years.
5. Include the from_date columns from the title and department are included to calculate tenure.
6. Use the salary table to calculate the current average salary.
7. Combine all of these elements into a single final current snapshot view.

#### Current Employee Snapshot

We will create view to get snapshot of current employees data for further analysis.

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot CASCADE;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot AS
-- apply LAG to get previous salary amount for all employees
WITH cte_previous_salary AS (
  SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT
      employee_id,
      to_date,
      LAG(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY employee_id
        ORDER BY from_date
      ) AS amount
    FROM mv_employees.salary
  ) all_salaries
  -- keep only latest valid previous_salary records only
  -- must have this in subquery to account for execution order
  WHERE to_date = '9999-01-01'
),
-- combine all elements into a joined CTE
cte_joined_data AS (
  SELECT
    employee.id AS employee_id,
    employee.gender,
    employee.hire_date,
    title.title,
    salary.amount AS salary,
    cte_previous_salary.amount AS previous_salary,
    department.dept_name AS department,
    -- need to keep the title and department from_date columns for tenure
    title.from_date AS title_from_date,
    department_employee.from_date AS department_from_date
  FROM mv_employees.employee
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.title
    ON employee.id = title.employee_id
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.salary
    ON employee.id = salary.employee_id
  -- join onto the CTE we created in the first step
  INNER JOIN cte_previous_salary
    ON employee.id = cte_previous_salary.employee_id
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.department_employee
    ON employee.id = department_employee.employee_id
  -- NOTE: department is joined only to the department_employee table!
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.department
    ON department_employee.department_id = department.id
  -- apply where filter to keep only relevant records
  WHERE salary.to_date = '9999-01-01'
    AND title.to_date = '9999-01-01'
    AND department_employee.to_date = '9999-01-01'
),
-- finally we can apply all our calculations in this final output
final_output AS (
  SELECT
    employee_id,
    gender,
    title,
    salary,
    department,
    -- salary change percentage
    ROUND(
      100 * (salary - previous_salary) / previous_salary::NUMERIC,
      2
    ) AS salary_percentage_change,
    -- tenure calculations
    DATE_PART('year', now()) -
      DATE_PART('year', hire_date) AS company_tenure_years,
    DATE_PART('year', now()) -
      DATE_PART('year', title_from_date) AS title_tenure_years,
    DATE_PART('year', now()) -
      DATE_PART('year', department_from_date) AS department_tenure_years
  FROM cte_joined_data
)
SELECT * FROM final_output;
```
Looking at our joined mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot VIEW.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
LIMIT 5;
```

### Dashboard Aggregation Views

##### Company Level Analysis

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.company_level_dashboard;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.company_level_dashboard AS
SELECT
  gender,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER ()) AS employee_percentage,
  ROUND(AVG(company_tenure_years)) AS company_tenure,
  ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary,
  ROUND(AVG(salary_percentage_change)) AS avg_salary_percentage_change,
  -- salary statistics
  ROUND(MIN(salary)) AS min_salary,
  ROUND(MAX(salary)) AS max_salary,
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary)) AS median_salary,
  ROUND(
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) -
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary)
  ) AS inter_quartile_range,
  ROUND(STDDEV(salary)) AS stddev_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY gender;
 ```

##### Department Level Analysis

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.department_level_dashboard;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.department_level_dashboard AS
SELECT
  gender,
  department,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department
  )) AS employee_percentage,
  ROUND(AVG(department_tenure_years)) AS department_tenure,
  ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary,
  ROUND(AVG(salary_percentage_change)) AS avg_salary_percentage_change,
  -- salary statistics
  ROUND(MIN(salary)) AS min_salary,
  ROUND(MAX(salary)) AS max_salary,
  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary)) AS median_salary,
  ROUND(
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) -
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary)
  ) AS inter_quartile_range,
  ROUND(STDDEV(salary)) AS stddev_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY
  gender, department;
```

##### Title Level Analysis

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.title_level_dashboard;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.title_level_dashboard AS
SELECT
  gender,
  title,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count,
  ROUND(100 * COUNT(*)::NUMERIC / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (
    PARTITION BY title
  )) AS employee_percentage,
  ROUND(AVG(title_tenure_years)) AS title_tenure,
  ROUND(AVG(salary)) AS avg_salary,
  ROUND(AVG(salary_percentage_change)) AS avg_salary_percentage_change,
  -- salary statistics
  ROUND(MIN(salary)) AS min_salary,

  ROUND(PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary)) AS median_salary,
  ROUND(
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.75) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary) -
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.25) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary)
  ) AS inter_quartile_range,
  ROUND(STDDEV(salary)) AS stddev_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY
  gender, title;
```


In our previous current_employee_snapshot table, we did not include manager details in our analysis.
In our following query, we will update our view and also add manager details alongwith all the prior existing data. 

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot AS
-- apply LAG to get previous salary amount for all employees
WITH cte_previous_salary AS (
  SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT
      employee_id,
      to_date,
      LAG(amount) OVER (
        PARTITION BY employee_id
        ORDER BY from_date
      ) AS amount
    FROM mv_employees.salary
  ) all_salaries
  -- keep only latest valid previous_salary records only
  -- must have this in subquery to account for execution order
  WHERE to_date = '9999-01-01'
),
-- combine all elements into a joined CTE
cte_joined_data AS (
  SELECT
    employee.id AS employee_id,
    -- include employee full name
    CONCAT_WS(' ', employee.first_name, employee.last_name) AS employee_name,
    employee.gender,
    employee.hire_date,
    title.title,
    salary.amount AS salary,
    cte_previous_salary.amount AS previous_salary,
    department.dept_name AS department,
    -- include manager full name
    CONCAT_WS(' ', manager.first_name, manager.last_name) AS manager,
    -- need to keep the title and department from_date columns for tenure calcs
    title.from_date AS title_from_date,
    department_employee.from_date AS department_from_date
  FROM mv_employees.employee
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.title
    ON employee.id = title.employee_id
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.salary
    ON employee.id = salary.employee_id
  -- join onto the CTE we created in the first step
  INNER JOIN cte_previous_salary
    ON employee.id = cte_previous_salary.employee_id
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.department_employee
    ON employee.id = department_employee.employee_id
  -- NOTE: department is joined only to the department_employee table!
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.department
    ON department_employee.department_id = department.id
  -- add in the department_manager information onto the department table
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.department_manager
    ON department.id = department_manager.department_id
  -- join again on the employee_id field to another employee for manager's info
  INNER JOIN mv_employees.employee AS manager
    ON department_manager.employee_id = manager.id
  -- apply where filter to keep only relevant records
  WHERE salary.to_date = '9999-01-01'
    AND title.to_date = '9999-01-01'
    AND department_employee.to_date = '9999-01-01'
    -- add in department_manager to_date column filter
    AND department_manager.to_date = '9999-01-01'
)
-- finally we can apply all our calculations in this final output
SELECT
  employee_id,
  gender,
  title,
  salary,
  department,
  -- salary change percentage
  ROUND(
    100 * (salary - previous_salary) / previous_salary::NUMERIC,
    2
  ) AS salary_percentage_change,
  -- tenure calculations
  DATE_PART('year', now()) -
    DATE_PART('year', hire_date) AS company_tenure_years,
  DATE_PART('year', now()) -
    DATE_PART('year', title_from_date) AS title_tenure_years,
  DATE_PART('year', now()) -
    DATE_PART('year', department_from_date) AS department_tenure_years,
  -- need to add the two newest fields after original view columns!
  employee_name,
  manager
FROM cte_joined_data;
```

From the output of above query we will not calculate average salary per tenure, gender, department, and title. 

```sql
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.tenure_benchmark;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.tenure_benchmark AS
SELECT
  company_tenure_years,
  AVG(salary) AS tenure_benchmark_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY company_tenure_years;

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.gender_benchmark;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.gender_benchmark AS
SELECT
  gender,
  AVG(salary) AS gender_benchmark_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY gender;

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.department_benchmark;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.department_benchmark AS
SELECT
  department,
  AVG(salary) AS department_benchmark_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY department;

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS mv_employees.title_benchmark;
CREATE VIEW mv_employees.title_benchmark AS
SELECT
  title,
  AVG(salary) AS title_benchmark_salary
FROM mv_employees.current_employee_snapshot
GROUP BY title;
```
